# ESG-asset-allocation
Here, I include asset allocation implementations with the integration of ESG criteria. Socially responsible practices and standards are a growing concern all around the world, so efficient ways of implementing it are being demanded. I am also passionate about ethics and social responsible standards such as environmental concerns, so I wish to learn about efficient ways of integrating this for investors in the financial sector. 
These implementations will attempt to use quantifiable ESG metrics, such as firm scores that measure how ethical they are in ESG criteria, in combination with asset allocation techniques.  


## Files Included:
1. **'5Methods_esg_allocation.ipynb'**: notebook file with a report written around the code discussing the topics included in detail along with each step of the implementation. 

2. **'5Methods_esg_allocation.py'**: python file with the raw code only from the report above.
