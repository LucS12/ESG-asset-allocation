# ESG-asset-allocation
Here, I include asset allocation implementations with the integration of ESG criteria. Socially responsible practices and standards are a growing concern all around the world, and no set way of doing this has been given yet. I am also passionate about ethics and social responsible standards such as environmental concerns, so I wish to find efficient ways of integrating this for investors.
These implementations will attempt to use quantifiable ESG metrics, such as firm scores that measure how ethical they are in ESG criteria, in combination with asset allocation techniques.
